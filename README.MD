## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @vodyani/coverage-report
```

## Usage

Typically, I would add the testResultsProcessor property stated in `JEST` to with the `CI/CD` execution and pass it in to take effect.

First, you should define the test commands in the `package.json` file beforehand.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
  }
}
```

And

```sh
npm run test --ci --testResultsProcessor="@vodyani/coverage-report"
```

**Output**

The reporter writes to `report.json` by default. The `JEST_REPORT_JSON` environment variable can be used to alter the file name.

Just like this.

```sh
JEST_REPORT_JSON="./coverage/report.json" npm run test:coverage --ci --testResultsProcessor="@vodyani/coverage-report"
```
